<a href="http://www.oxfordkarma.com/music/norman-music-festival-8-saturday-preview/">"There's plenty of great Oklahoma-bred club music (looking at you, Crystal Vision) and a resurgence of experimental electronic screwballs, but few bridge that gap the way LoneMoon does."</a>

<a href="http://www.smoothietunes.com/lonemoon/">"LoneMoon is a [17] year old musician from Oklahoma City. His music exudes profound emotion & makes the mind wander across the universe. With a father who is a singer and producer, he was passionately drawn to music at a young age."</a>

</p>
<a href="http://chiptuneswin.com/blog/stokin-the-forge-photographs-by-lonemoon/">"As a whole, [LoneMoon's] music rolls across the ear soothingly, warmly encouraging a listener to kick back and let their troubles melt away. It pairs sublimely with anything that involves pretending the rest of the world doesn't exist."</a>

<a href="http://dopemag.co/edm/lonemoon-i-promise/">"Lonemoon isn't your average producer and his music will not disappoint your ears. This up and coming producer uses his computer to make music that illustrates his love for the world and people around him. On a mission to defy genres, he aims to cover new musical territory with each release."</a>
