<a href="http://chiptuneswin.com/blog/stokin-the-forge-photographs-by-lonemoon/">"As a whole, [LoneMoon's] music rolls across the ear soothingly, warmly encouraging a listener to kick back and let their troubles melt away. It pairs sublimely with anything that involves pretending the rest of the world doesn't exist."</a>
<p>Shem Johnson, aka LoneMoon, started writing music in 2008 with the introductions of musicians like Deadmau5, Kill the Noise, AWOLNATION, Panic! At The Disco and Skrillex. He started writing melodies and producing sounds over and over until he achieved the sound he wished to achieve, and that came with hard work and practice.</p>
<p>As he progressed in music, with the release of his ep "Noir" and the well-recieved track "Answer Me", his hard work paid off when he achieved a reach of five thousand worldwide, live shows scattered around the state of Oklahoma, and most of all, the advancement of his passion. In early 2015, he released <a href="https://lonemoon.bandcamp.com/album/amaranth">"Amaranth"</a>, his first full-length and crowd-funded album - and first physical release.</p>
<p>In August 2015, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lonemoon/whereisluna1">"I Promise"</a>, the second track of his junior album, was released. Since, the track has amassed a staggering ~500,000 watches and streams across all platforms, becoming his most successful track to date.</p>
<p>Currently, as of October 2015, he has a reach of over 9,000 and over 1.5 million listens across all platforms. His one wish is to share his art everywhere under our earth's beautiful sattelite.</p>
